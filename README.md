# Probabilistic Rating system

The data you can find through this link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/s4qj0fpsn378m2i/chgk.zip 

- build a rating list that is able to non-trivially predict the results of future tournaments;
- at the same time, since ChGK is a hobby, and there are no contracts here, players constantly move from team to team, a strong player can play for another team for one tournament, etc.; therefore, the unit of the rating list should not be a team, but a separate player;
- and what greatly simplifies the task and translates it into the field of homework for the EM algorithm is the nature of the data: starting from some point, all the team's survey results began to be entered into the results database, i.e. there will be entries in the data like â€œwhich team answered which question correctly".
